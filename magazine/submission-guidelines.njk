    <h1 class="text-3xl mb-4">Articles and news for Pennant: Submission Guidelines</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Interesting and well written articles which will inform, challenge, educate or amuse
      are always welcome for Pennant magazine.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Could you write up news of your new ministry, or a reflection on a seminal moment
      during your time in the Royal Navy? What are your thoughts on how civilian ministry
      prepares clergy to become RN chaplains, or how easy it is for former chaplains to
      readjust to civilian ministry? Has being a Chaplain made you a better minister:
      perhaps a time when a lesson learned whilst serving with the RN or RM has enabled
      you to deal effectively with a tricky pastoral situation?
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Pennant, the magazine of Front Line Naval Chaplains (and incorporating the
      Association Royal Naval Chaplains newsletter Chaplains Chatter) promotes effective
      chaplaincy by connecting past and present chaplains and their families, along with
      others interested in this ministry. As well as items of news about our members we
      encourage a wide range of articles reflecting both seagoing and land based
      experiences, and including historical, personal and theological reflections which
      would be of interest to us all. In recent editions two New-Entry Chaplains described
      their journey to Naval Chaplaincy; we took a look into the archives to examine
      Admiral Beatty’s 1917 proposal for Naval chaplains to wear uniform, and we
      reviewed the Revd Mike Wishart’s new book “Onward Christian Sailors” … and
      more.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Articles are typically between 500 and 1000 words, and are usefully accompanied by
      one passport style photograph of the author and at least one other photograph to
      illustrate the article – ideally in landscape 900 pixels x 250 pixels (example image
      below). In the case of significantly longer articles please include a 500 - 1500 word
      abstract or introduction: we may then print only this in Pennant, along with the full
      article, which we can either link to, or distribute with Pennant, depending on file size.
      Shorter items of news (clergy moves etc) can also be included.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Notices and articles, including any abstract or introduction are best submitted with
      minimal formatting, and ideally not as a .pdf. Photographs can be in any format, but
      should be of as high quality as possible. Please note that we cannot guarantee
      acceptance, and we must reserve the right to edit articles including for length. You
      retain the copyright in anything you write, but by submitting it you give us the right to
      reproduce it in the magazine and on our website.
